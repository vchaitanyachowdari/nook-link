## üé® Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `build`: Build system or external dependency changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication

fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user service

docs(readme): update installation instructions

style: format code with prettier

refactor(database): optimize query performance

test(auth): add unit tests for login flow

chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
```

**Rules:**
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Capitalize first letter of subject
- No period at the end of subject
- Limit subject line to 50 characters
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Use body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*

### Code Style

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**

```javascript
// Use const for variables that won't be reassigned
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

// Use let for variables that will be reassigned
let counter = 0;

// Use meaningful variable names
const userAuthenticated = checkAuth();

// Use arrow functions for callbacks
array.map(item => item.value);

// Use async/await instead of promises
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await api.getData();
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

// Add JSDoc comments for functions
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers
 * @param {number} a - First number
 * @param {number} b - Second number
 * @returns {number} Sum of a and b
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Formatting:**
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at the end of statements
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Max line length: 100 characters

**Run the linter:**
```bash
npm run lint
```

**Auto-fix issues:**
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep line length under 80 characters
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include links to related documentation
- Update table of contents when adding sections

        name: 'John Doe',

      };
      
      const user = await UserService.createUser(userData);
      
      expect(user).toBeDefined();
      expect(user.name).toBe(userData.name);
      expect(user.email).toBe(userData.email);
    });

    it('should throw error for duplicate email', async () => {
      const userData = { email: 'existing@example.com' };
      
      await expect(UserService.createUser(userData))
        .rejects
