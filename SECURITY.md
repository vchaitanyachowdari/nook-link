## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Never commit API keys or secrets to Git
   - Use `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Enable Security Features**
   ```javascript
   // Example: Enable security headers
   app.use(helmet());
   app.use(cors(corsOptions));
   ```

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Run `npm audit` before deployments
   - Review dependencies quarterly
   - Monitor GitHub security alerts

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**
   - All PRs require security review
   - Check for common vulnerabilities
   - Validate input/output handling

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Only add necessary dependencies
   - Verify package authenticity
   - Review package permissions

3. **Secure Coding Guidelines**
